# How to run it?
## Requirements
Node.js >= 10.15.0

npm >= 6.4.1
## Build
```sh
yarn
```

Then...It's easy to run a local dev server!
```sh
yarn start
```

You could build the application if you had finished the development of current version.
```sh
yarn build
```
Then the application files will build to the `dist` floder.

# Start your development now!
Go! Write anything you want and create your world now!
